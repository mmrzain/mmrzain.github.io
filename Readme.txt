Hello! I'm a web development enthusiast currently honing my skills through Pitman Training. I've completed courses in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, which have equipped me with the ability to create visually appealing and efficient websites. My training has given me a strong foundation in web development and best practices. I'm eager to apply these skills to real-world projects and continuously expand my knowledge. My aim is to develop user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing websites that adhere to modern web standards.

I have created two basic websites:
1. **Cat Adoption Site** - An example of a home page.
2. **Tourism Sylhet** - Developed using Bootstrap.
